# Smart Timetable Management System

## Overview

The Smart Timetable Management System is a comprehensive Flask-based web application that provides multi-user portal functionality for academic timetable management. Built upon existing CSV datasets (7,200 students, 94 teachers, 73 subjects, 66 rooms, 125 activities, 864 slot indexes), the system offers role-based access control with admin, teacher, and student portals. Features include editable timetables, downloadable schedules, user authentication, and real-time data visualization.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Web Framework**: Flask with role-based authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with password hashing
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV data integration
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with responsive design
- **Testing Interface**: Streamlit applications for each user role

### Multi-User Portal Design
The system implements three distinct user portals:

**Admin Portal** (`routes/admin.py`)
- Full system control and user management
- Smart timetable generation from CSV data
- Complete CRUD operations on all data
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Downloadable schedules (CSV/Excel)

**Teacher Portal** (`routes/teacher.py`)
- Personal timetable management
- Limited editing capabilities (room assignments)
- Student and subject information access
- Class schedule downloads

**Student Portal** (`routes/student.py`)
- Read-only timetable access
- Personal schedule viewing
- Teacher and classmate information
- Downloadable personal schedules

## Key Components

### 1. Data Generators
Each generator is responsible for creating specific dataset types with realistic relationships and constraints:

**Student Generator**: Creates 7,200 student records with proper batch distribution (36 Scheme-A + 36 Scheme-B batches, 100 students each), department assignments, and campus allocations.

**Teacher Generator**: Generates 100 teacher records with subject expertise, availability slots, and campus preferences based on their specializations.

**Subject Generator**: Creates comprehensive subject catalogs for both schemes with prerequisites, corequisites, and lab requirements.

**Room Generator**: Generates room datasets across 4 campuses (Campus-3, Campus-15B, Campus-8, Campus-17) with proper capacity and equipment specifications.

**Activity Generator**: Creates activity records covering lectures, labs, tutorials, assessments, and extracurricular activities.

**Slot Index Generator**: Generates comprehensive time slot mapping dataset with 1,152 records covering daily schedules, weekly recurring activities, and special events across all campuses and schemes.

### 2. Web Interface
Flask-based web application (`web_interface.py`) provides:
- Dashboard with dataset statistics
- Dataset preview functionality
- CSV download capabilities
- RESTful API endpoints for data access

### 3. Configuration Management
Centralized configuration in `config.py` handles:
- Campus specifications and room allocations
- Time slot definitions and scheduling constraints
- Department and subject mappings
- Batch and student distribution rules

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**: System loads campus, department, and scheduling configurations
2. **Sequential Generation**: Generators create datasets in dependency order:
   - Students → Teachers → Subjects → Rooms → Activities
3. **Data Validation**: Each generator applies business rules and constraints
4. **Output Generation**: Datasets exported as CSV files to `/data` directory
5. **Web Interface**: Flask application provides access to generated data

## ML Pipeline Architecture

### Complete AI-Powered Pipeline
The system now includes a comprehensive machine learning pipeline based on the attached architecture document:

**Pipeline Components:**
